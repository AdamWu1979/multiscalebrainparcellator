Multi-Scale Brain Parcellator
=======================================================

This pipeline is developed by the Hagmannâ€™s group at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) for use within the `SNF Sinergia Project 170873 <http://p3.snf.ch/project-170873>`_, as well as for open-source software distribution.

About
*********

``Multi-Scale Brain Parcellator``, part of the Connectome Mapping Toolkit (CMTK), is a BIDS App that implements a full anatomical MRI processing pipeline, from raw T1w data to structural brain parcellation at five different scales.

The ``Multi-Scale Brain Parcellator`` pipelines uses a combination of tools from well-known software packages, including FSL_, FreeSurfer_, ANTs_ as well as in-house tools from CMTK.

This tool allows you to easily do the following:

- Take T1 from raw to brain parcellations at 5 different scales.
- Implement tools from different software packages.
- Automate and parallelize processing steps, which provides a significant
  speed-up from typical linear, manual processing.

Reproducibility and replicatibility are promoted through the distribution of a BIDSApp, a software container image which provide a frozen environment where versions of all external softwares and libraries are fixed.
